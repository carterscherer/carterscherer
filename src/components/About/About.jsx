          About 2 months ago I finally made the move to San Francisco, CA and now I live at SF2 with the
          Residency. I've been an entrepreneur since day one and over the years I developed quite a bit of
          expierience with building new gadgets that solve real world problems. When I made the move to the Bay
          Area I of course needed to pull out all the stops and take on contracts to make rent. Well turns out that
          designers in hardware are not that easy to come by and I had people coming to me left and right.
          SF is a place where startups come to raise, build and thrive as passionate visionaries that change the world.
